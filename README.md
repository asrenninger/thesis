### the relationship between built and natural environments to health

This analysis builds a county health index using data on both physical and mental health and models the relationship between health and a battery of socio-economic variables. It then incoprorates remote sensing to augment this model with information on the built and natural environments in those counties. The distribution of both dependent and independent variables are marked by strong spatial autocorrelation; we use spatial regression techniques to understand how these relationships vary across geographies.
